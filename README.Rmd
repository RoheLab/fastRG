`fastRG` quickly samples a broad class of network models known as generalized random product graphs. In particular, for matrices `X`, `S` and `Y`, `fastRG` samples a matrix `A` with expectation `X S Y^T` where individual entries are Poisson distributed. We recommend that you think of `A` as the adjacency matrix for a graph (or a multi-graph). Crucially, the sampling is `O(m)`, where `m` is the number of the edges in graph. Other algorithms are `O(n^2)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the network. For additional details, see the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02998).

## Installation

`fastRG` is not yet on CRAN. You can install the development version
with:

``` r
# install.package("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RoheLab/fastRG")
```

## Example Usage

The easiest way to use `fastRG` is to use wrapper functions that sample from popular graph models. For example, to sample from an Erdos-Renyi graph `n = 1,000,000` nodes and expected degree of five, we can use the `erdos_renyi()` function.

We *strongly* advise that you always set `avg_deg`, as it is easy to request very large and dense graphs without this scaling.

```{r}
library(fastRG)

A <- erdos_renyi(n = 10^6, avg_deg = 5)
```

By default we always get a `Matrix::sparseMatrix()`, but we can also ask for the graph as an edgelist as well.

```{r}
el <- erdos_renyi(n = 1000, avg_deg = 5, return_edge_list = TRUE)
head(el)
```

This results in a fast way to create `igraph` objects using `igraph::graph_from_edgelist()`.

```{r}
g <- igraph::graph_from_edgelist(el)
g
```

## Other languages

The `fastRG` sampler has been implemented in Python [here](https://github.com/yunjhongwu/matrix-routines/blob/master/fastRG.py).
