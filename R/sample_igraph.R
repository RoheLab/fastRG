#' @return An [igraph::igraph()] object that is possibly a
#'   multigraph (that is, we take there to be multiple edges
#'   rather than weighted edges).
#'
#'   When `factor_model` is **undirected**:
#'
#'     - the graph is undirected and one-mode.
#'
#'   When `factor_model` is **directed** and **square**:
#'
#'     - the graph is directed and one-mode.
#'
#'   When `factor_model` is **directed** and **rectangular**:
#'
#'     - the graph is undirected and bipartite.
#'
#'  Note that working with bipartite graphs in `igraph` is more
#'  complex than working with one-mode graphs.
