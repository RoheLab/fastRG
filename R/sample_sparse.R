#'   this means the `Matrix` object (1) has
#'   double data type, (2) is symmetric, and (3) is in

#'   For directed factor models, a sparse
#'   [Matrix::Matrix()] of class `dgCMatrix`. This means
#'   the `Matrix` object (1) has double data type,
#'   (2) in *not* symmetric, and (3) is in column
#'   compressed storage format.
#'
#'   To reiterate: for undirected graphs, you will get
#'   a symmetric matrix. For directed graphs, you will
#'   get a general sparse matrix.

  ### some comments on type-stability

  # there are three components of a Matrix object:
  #
  #   1. the data type (binary, integer, double)
  #   2. whether or not the Matrix is symmetric
  #   3. the storage format of the matrix
  #
  # the storage formats are: triplet, row compressed, column compressed
  #
  # sparseMatrix will give us a column-compressed (i.e. CSC) Matrix
  # by default, an a symmetric one, since we set symmetric = TRUE
  #
  # however the data type, and thus the corresponding Matrix class,
  # can vary. for bernoulli graphs (poisson_edges = FALSE) we
  # will get a binary data type, and for poisson graphs we get either
  # integer or double data (I forget which)
  #
  # further, Matrix provides tools to coerce between storage formats,
  # but casting between data types is only done implicitly. so
  # we are going to cast to matrix of doubles since that's
  # what has the widest support in extensions to the Matrix package
