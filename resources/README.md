fastRG: a linear time algorithm for sampling a generalized random product graph.
==============================

fastRG quickly samples a generalized random product graph, which is a generalization of a broad class of network models.   Given matrices $X \in R^{n \times K_x}$, $Y \in R^{n \times K_y}$, and $S \in R^{K_x \times K_y}$ each with positive entries, fastRG samples a matrix with  expectation $XSY^T$ and independent Poisson entries.  [See the tech report for sampling Bernoulli entries](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02998). 

The basic idea of the algorithm is to first sample the number of edges, $m$, and then put down edges one-by-one.  It runs in $O(m)$ operations.  For example, in sparse graphs $m = O(n)$ and the algorithm is dramatically faster than ``element-wise'' algorithms which run in $O(n^2)$ operations.

Installation in R
------------

```R

```



Functions 
------------
```R
fastRG(X, S, Y= NULL, avgDeg = NULL, simple = NULL, 
          PoissonEdges = TRUE, directed = FALSE, selfLoops = FALSE, 
          returnEdgeList = FALSE, returnParameters = FALSE)
er(n, p = NULL, avgDeg =NULL, directed = FALSE, returnEdgeList = FALSE,...)     
cl = function(theta, avgDeg = NULL, directed = FALSE, returnEdgeList = FALSE,...)   
sbm(n,pi, B, PoissonEdges = F, returnParameters = FALSE, parametersOnly = FALSE, ...)
dcsbm(theta,pi, B, returnParameters = FALSE, parametersOnly = FALSE, ...)

howManyEdges(X,S)
```
The functions er, sbm, dcsbm, dcMixed, and dcOverlapping are wrappers for fastRG. 

Arguments 
------------
```R
X                 # X in the gRDPG
S                 # S in the gRDPG

Y                 # if Null, Y <- X; if not, E(A) = XSY', directed <- T, selfLoops <- T, simple <- F
                  #   Y need not have same number of rows or columns as X.  matrix mult X %*% S %*% t(Y) must be defined.
  
avgDeg            # to help ensure the graph is not too dense, avgDeg scales the S matrix to set 
                  #   the expected average expected degree to avgDeg. If avgDeg = null, this is ignored.

n                 # number of nodes
pi                # a K vector of membership probabilities
alpha             # parameter of the dirichlet distribution in the assignment of block memberships in dcMixed
B                 # middle probability matrix  (this becomes S in fastRG)
theta             # vector of degree parameter in degree corrected and Chung-Lu models, 
                  #  the expected adjacency matrix becomes: 
                  #           diag(theta) %*% X %*% S %*% t(X) %*% diag(theta)
                  #  in dcMixed and dcOverlapping, if theta is a single value, then 
                  #  n <- theta and there is no degree correction.
returnParameters  # if TRUE, then it returns a list(A, X, S, Y).  This can be helpful for simulation studies which 
                              # seek to estimate X, S, Y.  If FALSE, then it returns A.  
                              # if returnEdgeList = TRUE, then this parameter is ignored.
parametersOnly    # if TRUE, then the wrapper only returns the X and S matrix that would otherwise be sent to fastRG.

simple            # if TRUE, samples a simple graph by setting PoissonEdges = directed = multiEdges = FALSE
PoissonEdges      # See Details
directed          # See Details
selfLoops         # See Details
returnEdgeList    # See Values
```

Details
------------
fastRG samples a Poisson gRPG where $\lambda_{ij} = X_i' S Y_j$ is the rate parameter for edge $i,j$.   If multiEdges is set to FALSE, then it samples a Bernoulli gRPG where the probability of edge $(i,j)$ is $1 - exp(-\lambda_{ij})$.  In sparse graphs, this is a good approximation to having edge probabilities $\lambda_{ij}$. Arugments can keep self loops or keep the graph directed.

er, cl, sbm, dcsbm, dcOverlapping, and dcMixed are wrappers for fastRG that sample the Erdos-Renyi, Chung-Lu, Stochastic Blockmodel, Degree Corrected Stochastic Blockmodel, the Degree Corrected Overlapping Stochastic Blockmodel, and the Degree Corrected Mixed Membership Stochastic Blockmodel.  To remove Degree correction, set theta = rep(1, n) or set theta equal to the number of desired nodes $n$.

If selfLoops == T, then fastRG retains the selfloops. If selfLoops == F, then fastRG uses a poisson approximation to the binomial in the following sense: Let $M\sim poisson(\sum_{uv} \lambda_{uv})$ be the number of edges. fastRG approximates edge probabilities of $Poisson(\lambda_{ij})$ with  $Binomial(M, \lambda_{ij}/\sum_{uv}\lambda_{uv})$.  This approximation is good when total edges is order $n$ or larger and $\max \lambda_{ij}$ is order constant or smaller.  Under er and sbm, there is a default correction that removes this issue. 

If directed == T, then fastRG does not symmetrize the graph.  If directed == F, then fastRG symmetrizes S and A.

If PoissonEdges == T, then fastRG keeps the multiple edges and avgDeg calculations are on out degree (i.e. rowSums).  If PoissonEdges == F, then fastRG thresholds each edge so that multiple edges are replaced by single edges. In this case, only SBM has edge probabilities exactly given by $\lambda$ (up to scaling for avgDeg).  The other techniques have edge probabilities $1 - exp(-\lambda)$.

If Y is specified, then it returns a sparse matrix, with poisson entries, where $E(A) = X S Y'$.  This is useful for creating sparse rectangular matrices.  For example, this could be a feature matrix.  Or, it could be a "rectangular adjacency matrix" for a bipartite graph.


Values
------------
By default, fastRG and its wrappers all output a sparse matrix from the package Matrix. If returnEdgeList = TRUE, then it returns an edge list matrix with m rows and 2 columns. 

howManyEdges returns a vector with two elements.  The first element is the expected number of edges. The second is the expected average degree.  

Example Usage
-------------
First, generate the edgelist for an Erdos-Renyi graph with n = 1,000,000 nodes and expected degree 5.  That makes the edge probability 5/n.  
```R
# install fastRG:
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlrohe/fastRG/master/fastRDPG.R")
# sample:
system.time(er(n=10^6, avgDeg = 5, returnEdgeList = F))
```

```R
n = 10000
K = 5

X = matrix(rpois(n = n*K, 1), nrow = n)
S = matrix(runif(n = K*K, 0,.0001), nrow = K)

howManyEdges(X,S)[-1]
A = fastRG(X,S, simple=T)

# if you want to create an igraph, it is fastest to
#   1) return an edgelist from fastRG and 
#   2) form the igraph from the edgelist.

library(igraph)
el = fastRG(X,S, simple=T, returnEdgeList = T)
g = graph_from_edgelist(el)
```

or fastRG also allows for simulating from E(A) = X S Y', where A and S could be rectangular.  This is helpful for bipartite graphs or matrices of features.

```R
n = 10000
d = 1000
K1 = 5
K2 = 3

X = matrix(rpois(n = n*K1, 1), nrow = n)
Y = matrix(rpois(n = d*K2, 1), nrow = d)
S = matrix(runif(n = K1*K2, 0,.1), nrow = K1)

A = fastRG(X,S,Y, avgDeg = 10)
```

```R

theta = rexp(n)

A = dcsbm(theta, pi,B,avgDeg = 50)
# here is the average degree:
mean(rowSums(A))  

# If we remove multiple edges, the avgDeg parameter is not trustworthy:
A = dcsbm(theta, pi,B,avgDeg = 50, PoissonEdges = F)
mean(rowSums(A))  

# but it is a good upper bound when the graph is sparse:
n = 10000
A = dcsbm(rexp(n), pi,B,avgDeg = 50, PoissonEdges = F)
mean(rowSums(A))
