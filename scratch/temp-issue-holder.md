igraph: SBM sampling

    Time complexity: O(|V|+|E|+K^2), where |V| is the number of

    vertices, |E| is the number of edges, and K is the number of

    groups.

    Time complexity: O(nnm), where n is the number of vertices,

    and m is the length of the latent vectors.




Add SBM sampling comparison to igraph to README #21

Enforce identifying assumptions for SBMs #19
Namely constraints on theta.


Use directedness of resulting graph as easy sanity check for correctness #13
