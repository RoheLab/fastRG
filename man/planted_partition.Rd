\usage{
planted_partition(n, k, within_block, between_block, sort_nodes = FALSE,
  ...)

planted_partition_params(n, k, within_block, between_block,
  sort_nodes = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of nodes in graph.}

\item{k}{Number of planted partitions.}

\item{within_block}{Probability of within block edges.}

\item{between_block}{Probability of between block edges.}

\item{sort_nodes}{Logical indicating whether or not to sort the nodes
so that they are grouped by block. This incurs the the cost of a
radix sort, which is linear in the number of nodes in the graph.
Defaults to \code{FALSE}. Useful for plotting.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed on to \code{fastRG}
\describe{
  \item{X}{An \code{n} by \code{k_1} matrix.}
  \item{S}{A \code{k_1} by \code{k_2} matrix.}
  \item{Y}{A \code{d} by \code{k_2} matrix. Defaults to \code{X}.}
  \item{avg_deg}{When specified, rescales parameter such that the
expected degree is \code{avg_deg} in the Poisson multi-graph. When
\code{poisson_edges = FALSE}, the resulting graph will have lower a
average degree than \code{avg_deg} due to lack of multi-edges. When
the graph is sparse, the expected number of edges for the Poisson
multi-graph and Bernoulli graph are nearly the
same. Defaults to \code{NULL}, such that no scaling occurs.}
  \item{simple}{When \code{TRUE}, indicates that you want to work with undirected
graphs where self-loops and multi-edges are prohibited. Accomplishes
this by setting \code{directed = FALSE}, \code{allow_self_loops = FALSE}, and
\code{poisson_edges = FALSE}, and then ignoring arguments \code{directed},
\code{allow_self_loops} and \code{poisson_edges}. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
  \item{poisson_edges}{Logical indicating whether or not multi-edges are
allowed. Defaults to \code{TRUE}, which keeps multi-edges and produces
a multi-graph. When \code{FALSE}, only single edges are allowed, resulting
in a graph. See \strong{details} for some additional comments. Effected by
\code{simple} argument.}
  \item{directed}{Logical indicating whether or not the graph should be
directed. Default is \code{directed = TRUE}. When \code{directed = FALSE},
symmetrizes \code{S} internally. When \code{X = Y} (which is the default when
no \code{Y} is specified), this results in a symmetric adjacency matrix
as output. When \code{avg_deg} is specified and the desired graph is directed,
the average degree scaling is on the out-degree of each node (or the
row sums if you prefer to think in terms of the adjacency matrix).
Effected by the \code{simple} argument.}
  \item{allow_self_loops}{Logical indicating whether edges are allowed from
a node back to itself. Defaults to \code{TRUE}. When \code{FALSE}, sampling
proceeds normally, and then self-loops are removed after sampling
is completed. Effected by the \code{simple} argument.}
  \item{return_edge_list}{Logical indicating whether to return an edgelist
rather than an adjacency matrix. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}}
}
\value{
A random Poisson (or Bernoulli) dot product graph. By default,
returns a \code{\link[Matrix:sparseMatrix]{Matrix::sparseMatrix()}} in CSC format (i.e. of abstract
class \code{CsparseMatrix}). When the graph is undirected, the \code{sparseMatrix}
will also be symmetric.

If \code{return_edge_list = TRUE}, instead returns the graph as an edgelist
in matrix format, with contains two columns called \code{from} and \code{to}.
The \code{from} column contains the index of the outgoing edge,
and the \code{to} column contains the index of the incoming edge.
