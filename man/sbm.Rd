\title{Sample a stochastic blockmodel graph}
\usage{
sbm(n, pi, B, avgDeg = NULL, PoissonEdges = TRUE, sort_nodes = TRUE,
  ...)

sbm_params(n, pi, B, avgDeg = NULL, PoissonEdges = TRUE,
  sort_nodes = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of nodes in graph.}

\item{pi}{Block sampling proportions. Must be positive, but do not need to
sum to one, as they will be normalized internally. Note that \code{length(pi)}
implicitly specifies the number of blocks.}

\item{B}{"Contains probabilities". TODO}

\item{avgDeg}{TODO}

\item{PoissonEdges}{TODO}

\item{sort_nodes}{Logical indicating whether or not to sort the nodes
so that they are grouped by block. This incurs the cost of a fast
integer radix sort, but even this may be prohibitive when sampling
large graphs. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed on to \code{fastRG}
\describe{
  \item{X}{An \code{n} by \code{k_1} matrix.}
  \item{S}{A \code{k_1} by \code{k_2} matrix.}
  \item{Y}{A \code{d} by \code{k_2} matrix. Defaults to \code{X}.}
  \item{avgDeg}{When specified, the expected average degree of nodes
in the output poisson multi-graph. When \code{poissonEdges = FALSE}, the
resulting graph will have lower average degree due to lack
of multiple-edges. When the graph is sparse, the expected number of
edges for the Poisson multi-graph and Bernoulli graph are nearly the
same. Defaults to \code{NULL}, such that no scaling occurs.}
  \item{simple}{When \code{TRUE} indicates that you want to work with undirected
graphs where self-loops and multi-edges are prohibited. Accomplishes
this by setting \code{directed = FALSE}, \code{selfLoops = FALSE}, and
\code{PoissonEdges = FALSE}, and then ignoring arguments \code{directed},
\code{selfLoops} and \code{PoissonEdges}. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
  \item{PoissonEdges}{Logical indicating whether or not multi-edges are
allowed. Defaults to \code{TRUE}, which keeps multi-edges and produces
a multi-graph. When \code{FALSE}, only single edges are allowed, resulting
in a graph. See \strong{details} for some additional comments. Effected by
\code{simple} argument.}
  \item{directed}{Logical indicating whether or not the graph should be
directed. Default is \code{directed = TRUE}. When \code{directed = FALSE},
symmetrizes \code{S} internally. When \code{X = Y} (which is the default when
no \code{Y} is specified), this results in a symmetric adjacency matrix
as output. When \code{avgDeg} is specified and the desired graph is directed,
the average degree scaling is on the out-degree of each node (or the
row sums if you prefer to think in terms of the adjacency matrix).
Effected by the \code{simple} argument.}
  \item{selfLoops}{Logical indicating whether edges are allowed from
a node back to itself. Defaults to \code{TRUE}. When \code{FALSE}, sampling
proceeds normally, and then self-loops are removed after sampling
is completed. Effected by the \code{simple} argument.}
  \item{returnEdgeList}{Logical indicating whether to return an edgelist
rather than an adjacency matrix.}
}}
}
\value{
A random Poisson (or Bernoulli) dot product graph. By default,
returns a \code{\link[Matrix:sparseMatrix]{Matrix::sparseMatrix()}} in CSC format (i.e. of abstract
class \code{CsparseMatrix}). When the graph is undirected, the \code{sparseMatrix}
will also be symmetric.

If \code{returnEdgeList = TRUE}, instead returns the graph as an edgelist
in matrix format, where the first column of the matrix contains two
columns \code{from} and \code{to} . The \code{from} column contains the index
of the outgoing edge in this case, and the \code{to} column contains
the index of the incoming edge.
