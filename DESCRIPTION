Description: Samples generalized random product graph, a generalization of
    a broad class of network models. Given matrices X, S, and Y with with
    non-negative entries, samples a matrix with expectation X S Y^T and
    independent Poisson or Bernoulli entries using the fastRG algorithm of
    Rohe et al. (2017) <https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v19/17-128.html>. The
    algorithm first samples the number of edges and then puts them down
    one-by-one.  As a result it is O(m) where m is the number of edges, a
    dramatic improvement over element-wise algorithms that which require
    O(n^2) operations to sample a random graph, where n is the number of
    nodes.
