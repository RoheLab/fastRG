Description: Samples generalized random product graph, a
    generalization of a broad class of network models. Given matrices X,
    S, and Y with with non-negative entries, samples a matrix with
    expectation X S Y^T and independent Poisson or Bernoulli entries. The
    algorithm first samples the number of edges and then puts them down
    one-by-one.  As a result it is O(m) where m is the number of edges, a
    dramatic improvement over element-wise algorithms that which require
    O(n^2) operations to sample a random graph, where n is the number of
    nodes.
