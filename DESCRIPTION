Description: Samples generalized random product graph, a
    generalization of a broad class of network models. Given matrices X,
    S, and Y with with non-negative entries, samples a matrix with
    expectation X S Y^T and independent Poisson or Bernoulli entries using
    the fastRG algorithm of Rohe et al. (2017)
    <url:https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v19/17-128.html>. The algorithm first
    samples the number of edges and then puts them down one-by-one.  As a
    result it is O(m) where m is the number of edges, a dramatic
    improvement over element-wise algorithms that which require O(n^2)
    operations to sample a random graph, where n is the number of nodes.
